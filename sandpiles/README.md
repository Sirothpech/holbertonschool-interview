# Sandpiles

## Tasks

### 0. Sandpiles sum

Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles.

- Prototype: `void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);`
- You can assume that both `grid1` and `grid2` are individually stable.
- A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains.
- When your function is done, `grid1` must be stable.
- `grid1` must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example).
- You’re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically.

Example:

```c
alex@~/sandpiles$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-sandpiles.c -o 0-sandpiles
alex@~/sandpiles$ ./0-sandpiles
3 3 3   1 3 1
3 3 3 + 3 3 3
3 3 3   1 3 1
=
4 6 4
6 6 6
4 6 4
=
2 5 2
5 6 5
2 5 2
=
4 2 4
2 6 2
4 2 4
=
0 5 0
5 2 5
0 5 0
=
2 1 2
1 6 1
2 1 2
=
2 2 2
2 2 2
2 2 2
```

### 1. Sandpiles sum (1)

Same as `0-main.c` except:

```c
int grid1[3][3] = {
        {0, 0, 0},
        {0, 0, 0},
        {0, 0, 0}
    };
int grid2[3][3] = {
        {3, 3, 3},
        {3, 3, 3},
        {3, 3, 3}
    };
```

Example:

```c
alex@~/sandpiles$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 1-main.c 0-sandpiles.c -o 0-sandpiles
alex@~/sandpiles$ ./0-sandpiles
0 0 0   3 3 3
0 0 0 + 3 3 3
0 0 0   3 3 3
=
3 3 3
3 3 3
3 3 3
```
