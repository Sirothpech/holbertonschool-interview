# Linear search in skip list

### Description
This repository contains a C program that implements linear search in a skip list. Skip lists are a type of data structure that augment the basic linked list with layers of pointers that allows for faster searching within the list.

### File Descriptions
- `search.h`: Header file containing the definition of the skip list data structure and function prototypes.
- `0-linear_skip.c`: Implementation of the function `linear_skip`, which performs a search for a value in a sorted skip list of integers.
- `0-main.c`: Main function to test the `linear_skip` function.

### Usage
Compile the program using the provided Makefile:
```
make
```
Run the executable:
```
./0-linear_skip
```

### Example Output
```
